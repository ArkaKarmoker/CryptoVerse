## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- Internet connection for API calls and CDN-hosted dependencies

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ArkaKarmoker/CryptoVerse.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd CryptoVerse
   ```
3. Open `CryptoVerse.html` in a web browser:
   - You can double-click the file or serve it using a local server (e.g., `python -m http.server` for Python 3.x).

### Usage
- **Market Overview**: View real-time cryptocurrency data in the interactive table. Click "Trade" to select a coin for trading.
- **Trading**: Select a coin, enter an amount, and click "Buy" or "Sell". The platform validates funds and holdings before processing.
- **Portfolio**: Monitor your holdings and total portfolio value, updated with live prices.
- **Wallet**: Add or withdraw funds via the wallet dropdown, selecting a payment method and amount.
- **Trade History**: Review recent transactions, including buys, sells, deposits, and withdrawals.

### Login Information
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `1234`

## Project Structure
- `CryptoVerse.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure, styles, and JavaScript logic.
- **External Dependencies** (loaded via CDN):
  - Bootstrap CSS and JS
  - Font Awesome
  - jQuery
  - DataTables
  - Google Fonts
  - CoinGecko API
- **Key JavaScript Functions**:
  - `fetchAllCryptoData()`: Fetches market data from CoinGecko.
  - `updateMarketTable()`: Populates the DataTables-powered market table.
  - `updatePortfolio()`: Updates user holdings and portfolio value.
  - `updateTradeHistory()`: Displays recent transactions.
  - `showPaymentModal()`: Handles fund addition/withdrawal with payment method selection.
  - `buyBtn`/`sellBtn` handlers: Process buy/sell transactions with validation.

## Limitations
- **Simulated Wallet**: The wallet and transactions are simulated and not connected to real financial systems.
- **API Dependency**: Relies on CoinGecko API for market data, which may have rate limits or downtime.
- **No Persistence**: User data (wallet balance, holdings, trade history) is stored in memory and resets on page refresh.
- **Single File**: All logic is contained in one HTML file, which may limit scalability for larger applications.

## Future Improvements
- Add local storage or a backend to persist user data.
- Implement user authentication for personalized accounts.
- Enhance security with proper input sanitization and API key management.
- Integrate charting libraries (e.g., Chart.js) for price history visualization.
- Support additional APIs for more comprehensive market data.
